# COSC-1336 Java Projects

This is a GitHub repository that holds all of the Java projects completed for the COSC-1336 Programming Fundamentals course. The projects are designed to build a solid foundation in Java programming, covering concepts such as data types, control structures, classes, objects, arrays, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Project Structure

Each project is stored in its own folder within the repository. The folders are named according to the project's title and include all of the necessary Java files, input/output files, and any other project-specific resources. Each project also includes a README file that provides an overview of the project's purpose and requirements.

### Getting Started

To run the Java projects on your own machine, you will need to have a Java development environment installed. The recommended development environment for this course is IntelliJ, but you are free to use any IDE or text editor of your choice.

To get started, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COSC-1336.git

Replace "yourusername" with your GitHub username.

### Contributing
