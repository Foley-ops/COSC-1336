/*Using a text editor, create a file that contains a list of at least 10 six-digit account numbers.
Read in each account number and display whether it is valid. An account number is valid only if the
last digit is equal to the sum of the first five digits divided by 10. For example, the number 223355
 is valid because the sum of the first five digits is 15, the remainder when 15 is divided by 10 is 5,
 and the last digit is 5. Write only valid account numbers to an output file, each on its own line. */
